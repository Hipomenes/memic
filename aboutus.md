Welcome to **MEMIC**: an interdisciplinary research group at the nexus of Medieval and Early Modern Iberian Studies. At the core of our research group are two questions: the technologies and materialities of cultures and texts; and the entanglements of cultures that came into contact in the Iberian worlds in Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Research questions cluster around translation and circulation, technology, literary theory, religion, race, memory, material culture, environmental humanities, and the world-making capacity of literature and culture. Methodologically, it engages with global studies, book history, translation studies, critical theory, philosophy, and anthropology... 

The central activity of MEMIC is our annual calendar of events (link to events). Sessions at the symposia, interviews, and workshops that we organize are published in our events section and nourish an ongoing debate about how our contemporary world addresses and redefines in the present the past of the Portuguese and Spanish cultures. In this respect, our goal is to reproduce through our monthly academic conversations an interdisciplinary landscape that informs of the main challenges and questions of our common field.

Among the members of MEMIC, there are participants affiliated with Boston University, Columbia University, CHAM, Chicago University, Reno University, Stanford University, UCLA, and Villanova University. We welcome any and all scholars of the period’s literature, history, philosophy, music, print culture, – in short, all scholars of medieval and early-modern culture – whose research finds a focal point in issues relating to the cultural and historical dynamics of the Iberan worlds.
