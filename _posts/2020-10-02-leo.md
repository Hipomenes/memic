In this workshop we will discuss the work of our member Leonardo Velloso Lyons. We will debate Leonardo’s dissertation chapter on the Early Modern mobilization of ideas about African geography in Miguel Cabello Balboa’s Miscelánea Antártica (1584).
Some key questions will be the representation of African geography and the conceptualization of historical and geographical knowledge about the African continent.
